<h1>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGY OF THE DIRECTED REFLECTION IN TEACHING PRACTICE</h1>

<p>The preparation of teachers-psychologists includes, in particular, their acquaintance to methodical problems of teaching activity. Teaching practice in psychology is directed to the development of a set of methods and techniques of didactic work. It's perspective, in our opinion, to use of model the training based on own experience of students.</p>
<p>Learning is a psychological process, and the teaching practice has the developed character. The structure of one consists of several modules with specific problems and the maintenance. There are a few modules in the program of practice:  the preparatory module, the observant-methodical module, the didactic module, the test module, the generelize module. Each module comes to the end with the analysis of performance by the student of corresponding teaching function. An obligatory condition is constant conducting an analytical Diary.</p>
<p>The didactic module is leading one of the practice because students has complete teachers' activities. The immersing in certain methodical and psychological cases and the collision with necessity operatively to make of a problem optimal decisions gives trainees rich and various individual experience. The teaching activity allows to stimulate theirs processes of self-comprehension. V.J.Ljaudis named such teaching practice as ²a space of modelling with the built-in-reflection².</p>
<p>We use a visiting of employment of fellow students as ²educational supervision². And especially significant we use a technique of  ²a three-cornered reflection² for the development of a student's meta-position. The dialogue and the analytical self-reports are fundamental in this technique. Dialogues in-between student collegues (as ²supervisors²) and between student and tutor are important. Responces from tutor and co-learners gives the student opportunities to question and rethink their own understandings. The meaning of good feedback is following: to give students information about study progress, about theirs competences. Activation of a valuable metareflective position can be considered as the precondition of early becoming of student's methodical skill.</p>
<p>The analysis of performance is carried out by probationers of teaching function by the special criteria. The use of a form  ²Balint's sessions² (as a professional training) is the most expedient for the analysis of student's achievements and for structurization of self-teaching experience. The reflective model of training is focused on the professional growth and on the actualization of personal potential of the student.</p>
<p>After studies in those processes (we named it as ²a strategy of the directed reflection²) the output competence should be some kind of blending of skills, knowledge end evaluation competence. To the major effects of teaching practice we refer:</p>
<ul>
<li>development to the skills of methodical designing and modelling of educational employment on the psychology, the new-grounded selection of type of interaction with an audience;</li>
<li>formation the professional pedagogical and personal qualities necessary for a successful realization in the field;</li>
<li>development of the research culture and the research approach to the educational process;</li>
<li>formation the creative attitude to teaching activity;</li>
<li>development of a need for self-education and mastering of teaching knowledge and skills;</li>
<li>stimulation of a metareflective position in the process of the analysis of self-experience and experience of other student's teaching.</li>
</ul>
