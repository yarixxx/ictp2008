<h3>
<a name="fmt_sbmsn"></a>Format of Submissions</h3>
<p>Submissions can be made in one or more of the following categories: (1) oral paper presentation, (2) symposium, (3) poster, or (4) participant idea exchange. Papers may be submitted as individual presentations or as part of a symposium.</p>
<p><b>Symposia</b> include thematically related presentations and discussants. A symposium is scheduled to last 1 hour 50 minutes. Conveners decide on symposium's structure and the number of presenters. We encourage symposia that include participants from more than one country in order to maximize interaction of participants from different parts of the world.</p>
<p><b>Papers and posters.</b> Those who wish to submit an individual paper may choose between an oral presentation and poster. The total time slot for an individual presentation is 20 minutes. Both oral presentations and posters submitted individually will be grouped by category topic into thematic sessions. The only distinction between an oral presentation and a poster is only the mode of presentation mode.</p>
<p><b>Participant idea exchange</b> sessions are round table discussions led by the participants who proposed the topic. The leader begins the session with a short presentation that is followed by a group discussion.</p>

<h3>
<a name="gdl_pa"></a>Guidelines for the Preparation of Abstracts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Abstracts are to be submitted in English, the official language of  ICTP-2008.</li>
<li>The title should be no more than 10 words and should clearly indicate the specific content of the contribution.</li>
<li>Abstracts for individual presentations should be no less than 450 and no more than 500 words.</li>
<li>Abstracts for individual presentations  should provide a description of the presentation and include the specific purpose of your presentation, a summary of the results, conclusions or  recommendations.</li>
<li>Abstracts for symposium should be no less than 1400 and no more 1500 words.</li>
<li>Abstracts for symposia should include a general  summary of the symposium that describes the theme and purpose of the symposium (200 - 300 words in length) and a 250 - 300 word summary of each presentation in the symposium that describes the information that each presentation will contribute to the symposium.</li>
<li>Avoid abbreviations in the title. Abbreviations may be used in the text  if they are defined when first used.</li>
<li>Choose one or more categories (from the list presented on the Abstract  Submission Form) that are most closely related to the content of a presentation.</li>
<li>Ensure that the abstract does not contain spelling or grammatical errors, because it will be reproduced  exactly as submitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is <strong>very important</strong> to follow the guidelines requirement of <strong>450-500 words</strong> and present the informative results <strong>in your abstracts</strong> since we plan to publish them in Program and Proceedings Handbook &mdash; one abstract per page. In this light the abstract <strong>should be informative, not only descriptive</strong>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="rvw_nap"></a>Review and Notification of Acceptance Procedures</h3>
<p>The abstracts will be reviewed by the International Program Committee with the assistance of reviewers from the International Advisory Committee. Conference registration is a condition for including abstracts in the conference program. At least one author should present at the conference for any submission. For submissions with more than one author, the presenting author will be notified of acceptance and should notify the co-authors.</p>
<p>Notifications of acceptance will be emailed to the presenting author. Detailed information, guidelines, and the recommendation for oral and poster presentations will be sent to registered presenting authors. Acceptance of abstracts by the International Program Committee does not include any financial assistance or fee reduction.</p>


<h3>
<a name="dl_sbmsn"></a>Deadline for Submission</h3>
<p>The deadline for submissions is January 27, 2008. Notification of acceptance for abstracts submitted by this deadline will be provided by February 15, 2008. 
This schedule will allow presenters enough time to register, reserve hotel accommodations, get a Russian visa, and prepare for the trip.</p>
