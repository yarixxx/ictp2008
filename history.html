<h3>History of the international conferences<br />on the teaching of psychology</h3>

<p>Interest in the internationalization of psychological knowledge has increased dramatically in recent years, not only in research but also in the teaching of psychology. <b>The First International Conference on Psychology Education was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2002</b> provided compelling evidence of this. It was an outstanding event that attracted about 100 representatives from 20 countries. We learned a lot about how psychology is taught around the globe. You can see materials from that Conference at the Web site:<br /> <a href="http://ltsnpsy.york.ac.uk/LTSNPsych/icope2002/index.html">http://ltsnpsy.york.ac.uk/LTSNPsych/icope2002/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the information shared at the First conference a special issue <i>International Practices in the Teaching of Psychology</i> was edited by Victor Karandashev and Sherri McCarthy and published by the <i>International Journal of Psychology</i>, 2006, 41, (1).</p>
<p>Many attendees at that conference suggested that similar conferences on a regular basis would be useful, so <b>the Second Conference on Psychology Education was held in Foz de Iguacu, Brazil, in 2005.</b></p>
<p>Based on the information shared at the Second conference the book <i>Teaching Psychology around the World</i> edited by Sherri McCarthy, Stephen Newstead, Victor Karandashev, Carlo Prandini, Claudio Hutz, and William Gomes was published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing in 2007.</p>
<p><b>The Third International Conference on the Teaching of Psychology (ICTP-2008) will be held on July 12-16, 2008, in St. Petersburg, Russia</b> (the conference was previously known as ICOPE and follows its tradition).</p>
